                <p class="body-text2">
                    This project was about building an online service for sustainability consulting. The website supported 2 types of users; customer users to submit their data and see consultants’ advice, and consultant users to analyze the customer’s input and to create a dashboard to provide guidance to their customers.<br>
                    <br>
                    This case study highlights a design for creating a WYSIWYG editor enabling consultants improving their confidence to publish a dashboard.

                            There were also UX problems we wanted to address.<br>
                            For example, consultant users were not able to see any of data (raw or graphs) when adding advice. There were 4 tabs were stacked in one screen.

                    I created a few variations of design based on my assumptions.<br>
                    <br>
                    Using the design combined with assumptions, I convinced the team to conduct a user research with the users so we can deliver a better service to our users.

                        We talked to consultants to understand their way of work better.

                        The most important discovery was that the consultants used Microsoft Word to create content together. Only the final content was copied and pasted from Word to the website. Word also made it easier review all content at once.<br>
                        <br>
                        The website auto-save function was also distrusted by the consultants, and they were afraid to lose their progress when working on the content on the website.<br>
                        <br>
                        It was important to see the graphs while working on the content.<br>

                    FINAL DESIGN
                </p>
                <p class="body-text2">In the end, I created an WYSIWYG type of editor where the consultants could see what the client will see during editing. Instead of recreating Microsoft Word, we decided to facilitate the consultant’s working flow using Word.<br>
                <br>
                The new look of the editor not only allowed the consultants to see all the graphs but also to see what the clients would see while editing. It gave the consultants reassurance of the dashboard they were publishing. Developers were also happy because we did not have to implement Word’s functionality such as collaborative edit, or auto-save.</p><br><br>
