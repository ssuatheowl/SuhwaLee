                <p class="body-text2">
                    My client sought an effective way to visualize their progress after adopting the innovation funnel methodology. As a team of three designers, we crafted a beautiful dashboard that offers an at-a-glance overview of the entire innovation funnel, along with detailed insights into each innovation project. Collaborating with two developers and one data analyst, we delivered an MVP powered by PowerBI. We also applied an adapted innovation funnel methodology ourselves, spanning problem validation, concept validation, and MVP creation. Throughout the process, I led the design team and worked closely with developers and the data analyst. Our design achieved such success that it was not only presented to the CEO but also shared during the company's annual meeting.

                </p>
                <p class="body-text2">
                    The client's organization had recently adopted the innovation funnel methodology, resulting in numerous initiatives being logged into their project management system, Viima. We were tasked with designing a digital dashboard capable of tracking the real-time progress of innovation projects within the innovation funnel.

                    PROBLEM VALIDATION<br>
                    — WITH USER INTERVIEWS
                </p>
                <p class="body-text2">
                    a real-time dashboard to track innovation progress appeared promising. To ensure that there were indeed unmet needs that could be addressed through this dashboard, we conducted interviews with innovation managers to validate the existence of the problem.
                </p>
                <img class= "round-corner" src="/Assets/dashboard/interview.png">

                <p class="body-text2">
                    Despite the influx of initiatives, they lacked a comprehensive overview of the entire innovation funnel. The progress of each project was tracked manually, with statistics maintained in an Excel spreadsheet, and monthly reports laboriously generated from the spreadsheet into PDFs—a labor-intensive process.
                    <br><br>
                    As a result, innovation managers and vice presidents across various departments found it challenging to visualize and monitor their progress. Innovation managers struggled to gain exposure for their projects to inspire others, while vice presidents of each department desired an engaging overview of innovations within their respective departments. Additionally, we needed to address the chairman's unmet need to track the potential revenue that could be earned from innovation projects in the funnel.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on the learnings, we created personas representing the needs of various end-users.

                During the research process, we discovered the following key insights:

                • There is a strong willingness to use the Digital dashboard.
                <br>
                • There is a need to enhance awareness of metrics for measuring the success of digital innovation initiatives, and the Digital dashboard can facilitate this.
                <br>
                • Setting targets is crucial to provide context for the metrics. Monthly targets are commonly used, and the graphs should align with these targets and display monthly progress.
