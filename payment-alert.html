                    At ABN Amro, we have turned the wasted effort into positive anticipation by implementing a payment alert service on the mobile banking app. We designed a flexible alert service that could be tailored to the individual user needs. The users could customize the settings to get informed of any transaction events of interest in their payment accounts.</p>

                    The copy for the push notification was decided based on the input from 100+ users.
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to include last 4 digits of an account along with the transactional amount in the notification. This was decided based the common user behavior that the majority of the users did not give any custom name to the account, which meant that the account name would have been the user's name.
                    <br>
                    So the only differentiator between accounts would only be the account numbers. Since the users felt the account number was a sensitive information to reveal via push notification, we decided to encrypt except for the last 4 digit to protect user data.

                    We have noticed that many colleagues had set up an alert for the incoming salary. It was fun to hear the synchronous sounds coming from the payment alert every payday at the office!</p>
