                    <p class="body">We can deal with a lot of matters digitally. The same goes for the banks. We want to deal with our bank matters whenever, wherever we are. ABN Amro, the second biggest Dutch bank, had enabled daily banking on digital platforms and was challenged to offer more regardless of time and location like any other modern banks.
                    To meet the versatile needs of the digital customers and also to save the cost of running services physically in bank branches, we introduced  a digital shop - digitized financial product acquiring processes
                    as one of those initiatives.</p>

                    <p class="body">In the mobile banking team, we were not happy with what we were seeing. The conversion on mobile was at least 5% up to almost 20% lower than that of the desktop, for exactly the same products.

                    Before I joined the team, this was an already on-going project that had been stagnant. There were goals, targets, and strategies. There were many, many more concepts. Inheriting all these works, I made a few more concepts and ran a series of user research as well. </p>

                    <p class="body">With limited resources and pressing time, one of the important questions was which target users and products to give priority to include in the Digitalshop.

                    We ran quantitative research with 1035 users, and it turned out that younger users were more interested in acquiring payment account, overdraft, savings account, or simple insurance products. The senior customers were less willing and in general, the users were reluctant to acquire more complex financial products such as mortgages or loans. Based on this, we came up with a set of products that needed our attention in our MVP version of the Digitalshop. The initial Digitalshop was optimized to present simple products and to present essential information around them.</p>
