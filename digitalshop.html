                    <p class="body">We can deal with a lot of matters digitally. The same goes for the banks. We want to deal with our bank matters whenever, wherever they are. ABN Amro, the second biggest Dutch bank, had enabled daily banking on digital platforms and was challenged to offer more regardless of time and location like any other modern banks.
                    To meet the versatile needs of the digital customers and also to save the cost of running services physically in bank branches, we introduced  a digital shop - digitized financial product acquiring processes
                    as one of those initiatives.</p>

                    <p class="body">With limited resources and pressing time, one of the important questions was which target users and products to give priority to include in the Digitalshop.

                    We ran quantitative research with 1035 users, and in turned out that younger users were more interested in acquiring payment account, overdraft, savings account, or simple insurance products. The senior customers were less willing and in general, the users were reluctant to acquire more complex financial products such as mortgages or loans. Based on this, we came up with a set of products that needed our attention in our MVP version of the Digitalshop. The initial Digitalshop was optimized to present simple products and to present essential information around them.</p>

                    The order of the products in the Digitalshop is personal. Products that the user currently does not have and likely to be interested in will appear on top. Products in possession will appear at the bottom of the list.

                    At the entrance of the Digitalshop, we are using the profile name to give a friendly personal touch.
                    At first, We wanted to call the users by the first name. However, user research revealed that the users were reluctant and less trustworthy, as it was different from the bank that was never using the first name to communicate. Instead, we decided to use the user profile name which is decided by the user. When the user has not set a profile name, then the digitalshop will greet without a name.
