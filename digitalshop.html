                    <p class="body">We can deal with a lot of matters digitally. The same goes for the banks. We want to deal with our bank matters whenever, wherever we are. ABN Amro, the second biggest Dutch bank, had enabled daily banking on digital platforms and was challenged to offer more regardless of time and location like any other modern banks.
                    To meet the versatile needs of the digital customers and also to save the cost of running services physically in bank branches, we introduced  a digital shop - digitized financial product acquiring processes
                    as one of those initiatives.</p>

                    <p class="body">With limited resources and pressing time, one of the important questions was which target users and products to give priority to include in the Digitalshop.

                    We ran quantitative research with 1035 users, and it turned out that younger users were more interested in acquiring payment account, overdraft, savings account, or simple insurance products. The senior customers were less willing and in general, the users were reluctant to acquire more complex financial products such as mortgages or loans. Based on this, we came up with a set of products that needed our attention in our MVP version of the Digitalshop. The initial Digitalshop was optimized to present simple products and to present essential information around them.</p>

                    <p class="body">With so many stakeholders who wanted to give inputs, this project was a long-halted one that could not go forward. To put all of our brains together, I facilitated a concept ideation session with all stakeholders to come up with a design that everyone was happy with, including our users!
                    <br><br>
                    Our design was born following these precious steps:<br><br>
                    &#42; We agreed on the most important criteria<br>
                    &#42; We agreed on the priority of the criteria<br>
                    &#42; We sketched all of our ideas on paper<br>
                    &#42; We evaluated the ideas based on the agreed criteria<br>

                    At the entrance of the Digitalshop, we are using the profile name to give a friendly personal touch.
                    At first, we wanted to call the users by their first name. However, user research revealed that the users were reluctant to be called by the first name. It also made the service less trustful, as it was different from the bank that never used the first name to communicate. Instead, we decided to use the user profile name which is decided by the user. When the user has not set a profile name, the digitalshop will greet without a name.
