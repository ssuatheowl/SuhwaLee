                    <p class="title">INTRODUCTION</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">We can deal with a lot of matters digitally.<br>
                    The same goes for the banks. we want to deal with our bank matters whenever, wherever they are. Daily banking, such as checking an account balance, making a transfer, on a digital platform has already become a necessity. And the banks are required to offer more convenience on a digital platform.
                    <br><br>
                    ABN Amro is the second biggest Dutch bank in the domestic market. The challenges for ABN Amro (like any other modern banks) were to enable their customers to deal with bank matters digitally regardless of time and location. Like any other modern banks, ABN Amro already offered daily banking on digital platforms - internet banking and mobile banking respectively. 
                    <br><br>
                    The increase in digital traffics means a decrease in physical traffic. Bank branches are closing down to cut off costs of running physical offices that tend to attract fewer visitors due to the digitization of their services. So, ABN Amro wanted to digitize even more processes to serve the new needs of the customers, and also to save the costs at the same time.  Digitizing financial product acquiring processes were one of those initiatives. </p>

                        </video>
                        </div>


                    <p class="title">PROCESS</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="subtitle">DEFINING TARGET USER</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                    The question was if the mobile application was the right medium for product acquisition. While Internet banking offered much more processes already, Mobile banking was selective in which services it was offering. We did not want to create a monstrous app that could possibly offer everything, but huge in size and running slow while finding anything you would want to be like a maze.  
                    <br><br>
                    So, as a UX designer, I started what I was good at, asking the very customers what they wanted. We asked ABN Amro customers of various backgrounds. The main questions we asked were such as:
                        <br><br><br></p>
                    
                        <p class="bodytext highlightedBody" style="font-style: italic;">" Would you like to acquire a new financial product, such as a bank account, savings account, investment account, loan, mortgage, etc via the ABN Amro's mobile banking app?"<br><br>
                            "What kind of products would you like to acquire?"</p>                
                    <br>
                    
                    <p class="bodytext">
                    <img class="jumbo" src=ABNAmro/Digitalshop/Willingness_chart_BW.png><br><br>
                    This research made it clear whom we should target.<br>
                    It turned out that it is well expected from the younger generations that acquiring financial products should be possible on mobile banking. However, older customers thought differently. The proportion of people who wanted to visit a physical bank branch to get their bank matters done increased. The older customers mentioned they would still visit a bank or use internet banking as they think either an acquiring process was difficult, or mobile app was difficult and should be simple.<br><br>
                    This research made it clear for us to put our priority on <b>serving the needs of the younger, tech-savvy customers.</b><br>
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p class="subtitle">CAPTURING USER NEEDS</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        <i>"Which products are you willing to acquire on the mobile banking app?"</i><br><br>
                        The research revealed which products people were interested in to acquire in the mobile banking app. We wanted to focus on the right product for the target group we chose. We made it possible by filtering out the results based on the age and the willingness to use the mobile banking app for product acquisition.<br>
                        <br>
                        We selected a few products that the customers were most willing to add in the mobile app.<br>
                        <br>
                        On a product level, customers wanted to get rather easy products such as a bank account, savings account, or a small loan that did not require massive documents for qualification. The mortgage was considered too complicated to happen digitally. and the pension was not a product of interest for our main target customer, the young and tech-savvy.<br>
                        <br>
                        Our customers also want to feel more welcomed and personalized in their banking app as well. ABN Amro, being one of the largest banks in Holland, had given a very traditional impression, trustworthy, but conservative and rigid. and we wanted to change that to make the bank more approachable and friendly to the customers.<br>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="subtitle">FINDING THE SWEET SPOT </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        The last challenge was to find that elusive sweet spot between user needs, technical constraints, and business goals.<br><br>

                         As a UX designer, I naturally wanted to introduce a platform that could serve the user needs at the most. However, being a UX designer also meant coming up with an optimized solution considering all the requirements and also the constraints. Aligning meant spending a lot of time talking to different stakeholders in a huge organization like ABN Amro.

                    <br><br>
                    <p class="subtitle">WORKSHOP</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        In the end, we had a joint workshop between stakeholders who represented three different backgrounds; business, design, and technology. The session facilitated by myself, it was consists of two parts - coming up with evaluation criteria and new concepts.<br>
                        <br>
                        The summary of the previous researches was presented for everyone to come up with various concepts and to agree upon the criteria we had to be concerned.
                        We came up with 6 different concepts through a brainstorm session, then came up with criteria to evaluate the concepts. The criteria were as the followings.<br>

                    <p class="bodytext">
                        The criteria gave a clear guideline to choose the best feasible concept.<br>
                        <br>
                        Later on, the chosen idea was drafted in wireframes, then visually developed and implemented to the current Digitalshop.<br>

                    <p class="bodytext">
                    ABN Amro’s payment alert is a push notification service that informs a transactional change for a payment account. 
                    <br>
                    The idea came from an insight that the most of the mobile banking customer open their app to check their balance and previous transactions. 
                    <br>
                    The main challenge was to select the right account the service should be applied for, and to find out a right message to deliver while filtering out sensitive information, and to come up with a configuration for the customers to customise the payment alert service.

                    <p class="title">PROCESS</p>
                    <p class="subtitle">BACKGROUND</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        From research, we got an insight that most of the mobile banking customers open their app to check their balance and previous transactions.<br>
                        <br>
                        We wanted to offer a more convenient way to keep track of their transactions, and we thought a push notification service to inform transactional changes in an account.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        </p>
                    <br><br><br>


                    <p class="subtitle">INTERVIEWS</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        We asked the customers of which transactional events they would like to get informed.<br>
                        The customers wanted to know when a balance goes below a certain amount, any debits or credits above certain amounts per account and transactions from a specific party - an employer, for example, to get notified once the salary arrives.<br><br>
                        Except for the transactions from/to a specific party which was technically challenging, the rest were implemented in the Payment alert service later on.<br><br>
                        </p>
                    <br><br><br>


                    <p class="subtitle">DESIGN</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        Based on customer needs, the first set of screens were created in wireframes to give a basic idea of the concept.
                        </p>
                    <br><br><br>


                    <p class="subtitle">USER TESTS</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        Our first drafts of the concepts were tested with the customers. This was done using paper prototypes then interactive prototypes as the concept got developed further.<br>
                        <br>
                        This process gave insights to the fine-tune the concept. We learned that we had to give a good title and explanation for the service so the customers can discover and understand the new functionality easily in the other overwhelming amount of settings. Secondly, a good overview of the accounts was needed as well, which one opted in for the notification and which one not.<br><br>
                        </p>
                    <br><br><br>



                    <p class="subtitle">COPYWRITING</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        Through a set of interviews, the copies for the Payment alert push notifications were drafted and revised so it can deliver the necessary information while hiding sensitive personal or transactional data.<br><br>
                        The customers were not fond of revealing a full account number, or total bank balance even in their own phone. This was due to the possibility of accidentally exposing such information to passers-by's.<br>
                        <br>
                        In the end, the last 4 digits of the actual account number were chosen to be shown as an account distinguisher. Other possibilities were also sought, however, an account type or self-given account nickname was not sufficient to specify a certain account for all the customers.<br>
                        <br>
                        The copies for the push notification configuration were revised to be more natural and conversational rather than technical or financial. For example, instead of giving a slider to select a range under the title "Balance status notification", the same functionality was presented as:<br>
                        <br></p>
                        <p class="bodytext" style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">
                        <i>"Notify me when my balance is lower than €..."<br><br>
                        "Notify me when my balance is higher than €..."</i>
                        <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p class="bodytext">

                    • Understanding user needs for push notification<br>
                    • Highlighting essential contents and limiting (encrypting) sensitive personal data in the push notification contents.<br>
                    • Finding a persuasive and compelling advertising moment and contents to promote the new payment alert feature within the app</p>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <p class="titleCol1">PROCESS</p>

                    <p class="subtitleCol1">RESEARCH</p>
                    <p class="bodytextCol1"><b>What information do the users want?</b></p>
                    <p class="bodytextCol1">
                        We asked the customers of which transactional events they would like to get informed.<br><br>
                        The customers wanted to know when a balance goes below a certain amount, any debits or credits above certain amounts per account and transactions from a specific party - an employer, for example, to get notified once the salary arrives.<br><br>
                        Except for the transactions from/to a specific party which was technically challenging, the rest were implemented in the Payment alert service later on.</p>

                        Based on customer needs, the first set of screens were created in wireframes to give a basic idea of the concept.</p>

                        Through a set of interviews, the copies for the Payment alert push notifications were drafted and revised so it can deliver the necessary information while hiding sensitive personal or transactional data.
                        <br><br>
                        The customers were not fond of revealing a full account number, or total bank balance even in their own phone. This was due to the possibility of accidentally exposing such information to passers-by's.
                        <br><br>
                        In the end, the last 4 digits of the actual account number were chosen to be shown as an account distinguisher. Other possibilities were also sought, however, an account type or self-given account nickname was not sufficient to specify a certain account for all the customers. 
                        <br><br>
                        The copies for the push notification configuration were revised to be more natural and conversational rather than technical or financial. For example, instead of giving a slider to select a range under the title "Balance status notification", the same functionality was presented as:<br><br>
                        "Notify me when my balance is lower than €..."
                        "Notify me when my balance is higher than €...".
                        <br><br>
                        Based on the insights, the copy was carefully worked out with close collaboration with a professional copywriter and a translation agency.
