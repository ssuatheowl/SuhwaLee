                    I am Suhwa <small>(pronounced as <em>[Su&#720; hua]</em>)</small>.<br>I am a UX designer, a user researcher, and an enthusiastic maker.<br><br>
                    Born and raised in Korea and currently based in Amsterdam. <br>
                    I lived 6 countries in 4 continents.<br><br>
                    I have worked on various digital products, from conceptualization to implementation. I am interested in tangible interaction and how it can enrich both digital and non-digital experiences  I am curious how our next media experience would look like, and how it will shape our lives differently.

                    As a child, I was passionate about art and crafts. At the same time, I was very good at science and math. My good school scores led me to enter KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), the best engineering university in South Korea. I took various courses in the freshman year, which included programming, calculus, general physics, biology, etc <em>(you name it)</em>.<br><br> After the freshman year, the moment of choice came, to decide on a major. And this is when my passion for art and craft took an action. I chose to study Industrial Design. Basically, I wanted to be an <b>artsy person who knows how things work</b>. 
                    <br><br>
                    My program heavily focused on User experience design, regardless of the medium. With an engineering background, I was taught to program, to make things move, talk, and interact with the users. My education definitely succeeded in transforming me as a <b>designer-maker</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    My design journey has encompassed many places in the world. I did an exchange program at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) in Australia, then a master program in TU Delft in the Netherlands, with three internships in South Korea, Lunar Design in Germany, and Designit in Denmark. I believe learning and working globally brought me competence that can meet global standards.
                    <br><br> 
                    Back to work again, I have worked on various in-house and client projects. My role has always been a UX designer, however with diverse tasks; figuring out problems and user needs from various research activities in the fuzzy front end, user testing for a proof of concept, and delivering pixel perfect assets in the implementation phase.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from design, I love COOKING, HISTORY, AND POLITICS. I often host a cozy dinner party with friends and we end up might discuss history/politics over few drinks. And Yes, I do <a class="underline_p" target="_blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/ssuatheowl">instagram</a> my food photos! One of my dream is to make my own exotic cookbook with my own recipes, illustrations, and of course, the cover design.
