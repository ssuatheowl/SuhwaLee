                <p class="body-text2">
                    Carepay’s Agent app was built to facilitate healthcare agents to enroll people to state’s and private healthcare program to provide them with healthcare benefits. Despite 1000 agents using the app daily, the app seemed to have very poor usability along with its rough look. To assess the status quo and to convince the business to agree to the major redesign, we used various usability assessment methodologies. We also established a user research ritual that can be applied to any future projects.

                <p class="body-text2">
                    During the peak days, almost 1000 agents per day in Kenya and Nigeria use the Carepay Agent app to enroll new beneficiaries across the country, reaching out to the poor living in remote villages.
                    <br><br>
                    While the app had been up and running for 2 years, no feedback had been gathered, and no UX improvements had been made. The app looked rough and difficult to use.
                    <br><br>
                    Our design team wanted to turn this to an opportunity to advocate human-centered design by starting user research. I wanted to listen to the end-user’s feedback and made design decisions based on that. As a team, we also wanted to establish a user research ritual that we can continue following in the future.

                    — Usability-evaluation method by usability experts
                </p>
                <p class="body-text2">
                    We wanted to demonstrate the poor usability of our product and highlight the value of usability assessment. We had to quantify the usability without breaking the bank. Our MVP approach was to use PURE (Pragmatic Usability Rating by Experts) method. A team of 4 designers rated all major features of the app. It was not only a very cost-effective approach, it also had much more credibility than me calling for a bad usability.

                <p class="body-text2">
                    After establishing that our app wasn’t anywhere where we wanted to be, we gained more traction to validate the bad usability with the end-users. This time, the System Usability Scale (SUS) was used to evaluate the product usability quantitatively. We sent out a spreadsheet to 10 of our users.
                    <br><br>
                    We also assessed customer satisfaction by asking our users to rate the app on a scale of 1 to 5.

                </p>
                <p class="body-text2">
                    As a seasoned designer, I have done various user research in my career. However, COVID-19 brought many challenges to the conventional testing methods. Because I couldn't fly to Africa to meet the user nor hand over a test device in a laboratory setup, usability testing had to adapt.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    <img class= "round-corner center" src="/Assets/agent-app/illustrations/research-setup.webp" style="max-width:600px;">
                    <br><br>
                    Because we had to test an app remotely, it complicated the research setup furthermore.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    • The researcher needs to see both of the app & participant.
                    <br>
                    • Because of this, we needed to use Team viewer to see the app, in addition to Zoom to see the participant.
                    <br><br>
                    • The researcher needs to record the session including sound.
                    <br>
                    • We could not use Zoom to record the session, because it wouldn’t record the app screen shared outside of Zoom.
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, I came up with a setup that enabled me and the team to talk to users in remote places.
