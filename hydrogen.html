                <p class="body-text2">
                    A client approached for 5 screens of simple interaction for hydrogen production. It quickly turned out that the context was technical and complicated, and with the client’s expectation beyond the realistic scope — each of 5 screens having to represent hydrogen ordering, order management, hydrogen production planning & management.

                    To make the complicated requirements digestible and design a successful service for this one-of-a-kind innovative operation, I applied a various service design methodology to make multiple breakthroughs. I created a service blueprint to visualize the complex context simple which identified (feature) gaps and encouraged valuable and crucial discussions to close the gaps. This resulted in redefining MVP.

                <p class="body-text2">
                    A client, building europe’s one of the first green hydrogen power plant, needed a software that will enable their client to order hydrogen and enable themselves to manage orders, plan hydrogen production, manage production and monitor (report).

                    The timeline of the European energy market was closely tied to a hydrogen production. While the information was crucial to understand the timeline to design an operational system for the production, the complicated energy market timeline made the technical topic even more complex.<br><br>

                    From the mechanics of energy market to the science of hydrogen production, it was difficult to determine valuable information that has design implications.<br><br>
                    <span class="body-text bold">Non-existing users</span><br>
                    The company being new and building their first hydrogen power plant meant that we had no existing user base. Everything needed to be imagined and defined by ourselves.<br><br>

                    In our conversations, the client kept using several units  — Wattage, ton, kg, cubic meter, liter, etc — interchangeably. That was because electricity converts to power to certain amount of hydrogen, and pressurized hydrogen can be measured by weight but also by volume (at a certain pressure). But this was very confusing to non-technical party. so we made a decision to stick to one unit (kg) during our discussion.

                    For example, while the system’s backend is based on the 36 hour cycle optimised for the current energy market schedule, a decision was made to show a 24 hour cycle when it comes to product UIs which is more natural & intuitive for human to interpret, which also fits better with 8-hour employee work shift.
