                </p>
                <p class="body-text2">
                    My client was seeking for an effective way to visualize their progress after adopting the innovation funnel methodology. We, a team of 3 designers, designed a beautiful dashboard that provides an at-a-glance overview of the entire innovation funnel and details of each innovation project. Together with 2 developers and 1 data analyst, we also delivered an MVP powered by PowerBI. We applied an adapted innovation funnel methodology ourselves too, from problem validation, concept validation to creating an MVP. During the process I led the design team and collaborated closely with developers and data analyst. Our design was so successful that it was presented to the CEO and shared during the company’s annual meeting.

                    THE PROBLEM
                </p>
                <p class="body-text2">
                    A corporation recently had adopted the innovation funnel methodology. There were many initiatives being logged into their project management system (Viima). However the overview of the entire innovation funnel was lacking and the progress of each projects were tracked rather manually. The statistics were kept in an Excel spreadsheet and monthly reports were created based on the spreadsheet in PDFs, which was quite a labor-intensive. Because of this, innovation managers and vice presidents in various departments were struggling to visualize and track their progress. So we have been told to design a digital dashboard that could track the real-time progress of the innovation projects in the innovation funnel.

                <p class="body-text2">
                    The idea to have a real-time dashboard that will show the progress of the innovation seemed promising. And we wanted to make sure to validate that there were unmet needs that will be resolved by building the dashboard. So we conducted interviews with innovation managers and validated that the problem really exists.

                    Innovation managers were struggling to gain expose their projects to inspire others. Vice presidents of each department wanted to have an engaging overview of innovations within their department. We also had to meet the chairman’s unmet needs, that he would like to track potential revenue that could be earned by innovation projects in the funnel.<br>
                    We created personas that represents needs of various end-users.<br><br><br><br>

                 Along the research process, we learned the following.
                <br><br>
                • There is a great willingness to use the Digital dashboard.
                <br>
                • There is a need to raise awareness in metrics to measure the success of digital innovation initiatives, and the Digital dashboard can help this.
                <br>
                • Targets are important to show to put the metrics into perspective. Monthly targets are prevalent, and graphs need to support this and show monthly progress.
