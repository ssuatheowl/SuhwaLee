                    After adopting the innovation funnel methodology, my client was seeking an effective way to track progress of their innovation projects and communicate them effectively. We designed a beautiful dashboard that provides an at-a-glance overview of the entire innovation funnel and details of each innovation project. Together with developers, we also delivered an MVP powered by PowerBI. We followed our own innovation funnel methodology ourselves too, from problem validation, concept validation to creating an MVP.

                    We created concepts based on validated insights and assumptions. As soon as we had wireframes ready, we continuously validated our concepts with our potential end-users. 
                    I made sure that we take a structured approach by <strong>documenting our assumptions and validating them via our research efforts.</strong> Our assumptions also addressed multiple domains: desirability, business viability and technical feasibility.

                    We explored how we are going to power the dashboard. Via a few workshops that was facilitated by me, we created a service blueprint that illustrates how we will power the imagined customer journey with available human and technical resources.

                    I also facilitated a couple of user story mapping sessions to help creating a high-level backlog with epics and user stories so we can create a functional product that can benefit our intended end-users.

                    Being a consultant means that you leave your good design with the good hands, and you don't get to stay until your project really blooms and performs. Still, I know we did a great job. How do I know that?
