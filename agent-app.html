                    <p class="body">During the peak days, almost 1000 agents per day in Kenya and Nigeria are using the Carepay Agent app to enroll new beneficiaries across the country, especially to reach out to the poor living in villages. While the app has been up and running for 2 years, no feedback was gathered nor any UX improvement was made. So this was a perfect opportunity to hear the agentsâ€™ voices and make it a ritual to improve the app. </p>

                    I believe that concept validation is an important key to create a successful product and service that meets the user needs. So I have also done various validations by conducting a series of usability testing in my career. And COVID-19 pandemic changed my work situation, working from home connecting with colleagues digitally, to begin with. 

                    And Usability testing had to adapt as well. The conventional way is challenged because I simply couldn't fly to Africa, meet the user, and hand over a test device in a laboratory setup.
                    <br><br>
                        So I came up with a setup that can enable me and the team to talk to users of Kenya and Nigeria.
